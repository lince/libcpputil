-------------------- Library Cpp Util --------------------

The library cpp util contains some utility classes for C++ development. 
It's developed for Linux, but can be compiled to other plataforms because it use cmake for generate compiling scripts.

Some features presentes are:

-> Easy and lightweight logging API;
-> Threading and Sinchronization classes;
-> High-Level network sockets API;
-> Pre-built and easily extensible exceptions classes; e
-> Complete Date and Time class support;

-------------------- Dependencies --------------------

The libcpputil has very few dependences. So, it's very easy to be compiled.

-> cmake (sudo apt-get install cmake)
-> uuid (sudo apt-get install uuid-dev)

-------------------- Installing --------------------

The steps to compile and install the libcpputil are the following:

$ git clone git://github.com/lince/libcpputil.git libcpputil
$ cd libcpputil
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install

Optionaly, you also can generate the documentation of the library, in the root directory:

$ dogygen

-------------------- Directories Structure --------------------

The root director libcpputil contains four directories and, due to installing process, two more can be generated.
The directories and their descriptions are the following:

-> include: It's here that the c++ headers file are.
-> src: It's here that the c++ source files of the library are.
-> ticpp: It's here that the tinyxml c++ code is. This code is integrated with our code because the tinyxml doesn't offers normal libraries.
-> test: It's here that several programs designed to test our library are. You can use it as samples code.
-> build: This directory is used durring the compilation process. You can delete it if you want.
-> doc: It's that the doxygen puts the generated documentation files.
